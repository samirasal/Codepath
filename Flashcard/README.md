## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I initially wasn't sure if i needed to create a flashcard.css file and merge everything into the app.css but i ended up creating it for better readability. One challenge I faced was making sure the gif appeared on the side i wanted it to. It took me a while to figure it out and thanks to ChatGpt I was able to complete the project.
