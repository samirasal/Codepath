## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had challenges when it came down to the CSS. I was unsure of whether I needed to create separate files for both App.css and Card.css
I also had issues when I tried feeding in the web app the list of fashion brands that use innovative technology. I didn't know It would be easier to put that list in a js file on it's own and then import to the files that needed it.
It was a lot of trial and error but I was able to complete all that required!
